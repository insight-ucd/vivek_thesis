# Overview

Automatic sentiment analysis under information extraction is an important field
and continues to receive interest from the academic community. The aim is to
extract sentiments and opinion from user reviews and use the extracted features
and sentiment to classify the reviews and more importantly to use them for
generating personalised recommendations.

For generating recommendations, Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the standard
technique. It provides personalized recommendations to users based on a profile
of user preferences, from which users having similar tastes are identified. It
then recommends to a target user, the items liked by other similar users. Some
music review banks, such as Amazon Customer Reviews on its music sales, allow
users to provide comments in free text format. Such User generated reviews also
come with a “user rating”, and connecting this rating with the sentiment in the
text is a problem we will explore. Being free text generated by users, the
reviews do not possess the same structure or format, and generally they are
unstructured and of mixed sentiments, affecting the overall sentiment of the
review. Previous approaches to sentiment analysis based on transfer learning
have a critical problem in that they only work well on a single source domain
and a single target domain. For example, the adjective ''unpredictable'' may
have a negative orientation in an automotive review, in a phrase such as
''unpredictable steering'', but it could have a positive orientation in a movie
review, in a phrase such as “unpredictable plot''. A word like “sick” has a
negative sentiment in domains like medical or general conversation, but in the
domain of music reviews, the word has a positive impact. Such incidents lower
the quality of our recommendation engine if they are classified wrongly.

This research will be focused on exploring various techniques that shed a light
on overcoming the stated problems in automatic sentiment extraction and
analysis on music reviews to generate personalised music recommendations. In
our work, we will first pre-process the user reviews using NLTK
techniques. After which, the tokenised words would be plotted on a Word2Vec
vector space model of around 200 dimensions. These word vectors would then be
plotted on a Sent2Vec vector space model, where the polarity of these words
would be classified using various Machine Learning Techniques like Naive Bayes,
SVM (Support Vector Machines), Decision Trees, etc. We will build a ternary
task of classification of sentiment into positive, negative and neutral
polarities. Further, we would utilize this sentiment classification into our CF
based Recommendation System to enhance the quality of the recommendations.
